    "# NB I used PowerShell's Measure-Command cmdlet to measure the execution time of my programs. I found that there was two problems with this approach. The first being that the cmdlet measures the time taken to import modules. The second problem was that the time was affected by other events happening in my system which affected CPU useage and memory. In the future I will use the timeit module which avoids the first problem at least. I could have taken the sample means of eaach programs execution time for comparision but I felt that for our purposes that was zealous and cumbersome. "
